"""Domain glossary — glossary-pin domain terms to the target_label vocabulary.

OWNER: Shruthi. Spec: docs/DESIGN.md §8.

Scoped to the five frozen `TargetLabel` values (contracts/enums.py). Kept
small and reviewable on purpose — docs/DESIGN.md §8's own example is one
entry: करपा -> blast.

S0 caveat, load-bearing: `StubTranslator` (providers.py) is an identity
passthrough — it performs no real translation yet. Until S3 wires live
Mayura, THIS glossary is the only thing that ever turns a Devanagari domain
term into its English target_label — that is why "करपा" is a glossary key
and not something left for the translator to handle. Broader Marathi/Hindi
disease-name coverage is a follow-up for domain-expert review, not something
guessed at here.

# Longest term first so a phrase (e.g. "brown spot") is matched whole rather

#
# Boundaries are whitespace-adjacency, i.e. (?<!\S)/(?!\S), not \b. Python's
# \w does not include Devanagari combining vowel signs (matras) — category Mc,
# e.g. U+093E in "करपा" — so \bकरपा\b silently fails to match on almost any
# real Marathi word, one of which has a matra. Whitespace-adjacency is
# script-agnostic and does not depend on Unicode word-char categorisation.
